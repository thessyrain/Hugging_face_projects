Excited to share my latest project!

Iâ€™ve just built a Smart Factory Job Scheduling Visualizer â€” an interactive web app that helps visualize how factories schedule jobs across machines. 

In a factory, multiple jobs need to be assigned to several machines efficiently. The challenge? Minimizing total completion time, or makespan. My app makes this concept simple and interactive:

âœ… Set the number of jobs and machines
âœ… Choose between Greedy and Random scheduling algorithms
âœ… See job assignments in a colorful Gantt chart
âœ… Check the total makespan instantly
âœ… Download schedules as a CSV file for analysis

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m proud of how this turned out and excited to keep exploring smart manufacturing, optimization, and AI tools!
